# Microsoft Scuplt Ergonomic Keymap for macos
Keymap for the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic keyboard for macos

## Why / How

The excellent Microsoft Sculpt keyboard isn't properly recognised on macos. I found the very helpful [Ukelele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/) that allows to create new keymap, and created a keymap for the UK version of that keyboard.

## Installation

- Download the `Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard UK.keylayout` file from this repository.
- Copy the file into the keyboard layouts `sudo cp Microsoft\ Ergonomic\ Keyboard\ UK.keylayout /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts`
- Reboot (yep...)
- Configure the keyboard, it will be visible under the "Other" category
